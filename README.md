# farmland-bird-survey
This is a survey of a small area of highly heterogenous farmland in central Israel. The basic concept is to build a basic Bayesian inference model based on point-counts of birds and connect bird abundance with crop type, crop area and other covariates.
This survey is a preliminary study to assess the feasibility of this approach. If it shows promise, the model could be extended by adding more data and other covariates from other areas, to make the model more generally applicable.
If successful, the model could be used to forecast the effect of changes in agricultural practices or to enhance bird diversity by adjusting the agricultural environment.
